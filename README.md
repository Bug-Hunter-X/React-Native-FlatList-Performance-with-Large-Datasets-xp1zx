# React Native FlatList Performance with Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native when using FlatList with large datasets. The app becomes sluggish and unresponsive due to the rendering of a large number of components. 

## Problem

The initial render of the FlatList with a large dataset (1000 items in this example) causes significant lag and blocking of the main thread.  This is primarily due to the default behavior of rendering every item at once.

## Solution

The provided solution implements several optimizations to enhance the performance:

* **Virtualization:** FlatList is already optimized for virtualization. This means that only the items currently visible on the screen are rendered. 
* **Optimistic rendering:** The solution makes minor changes to optimize data loading, but does not require significant changes to the FlatList itself. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the lag during initial render.
